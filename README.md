## Before started

- Please make sure you have installed **Node** beforehand. (If you don’t know how to install Node.js, please check [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
- When you open the program in **VSCode** (If you haven’t installed it yet, please download it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)), open the terminal window, and input the following code to install all necessary plugins and libraries.

```
npm i
```

- Prior to editing or further developing our app, please ensure that you have installed **Vue** and **Vue-CLI globally**. To learn how to install Vue related libraries on your PC globally, please follow these links: [https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) and [https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).
- If you plan to include data such as 3D Tiles, Point Cloud Data, DEM, or any complex 3D model, we strongly recommend that you install **CesiumLab** ([http://cesiumlab.com/](http://cesiumlab.com/)). This software can assist you in translating many 3D GIS data and creating a REST API for easily adding data into Cesium.
